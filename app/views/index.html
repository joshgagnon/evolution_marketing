        <h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
        <p>With most things in life, you get what you pay for.  But when it comes to legal services, most of the time it’s not exactly clear what you’re ‘getting’.  It’s even less clear what distinguishes one law firm from another.  Practically every law firm out there claims to offer services that are ‘client-focused’, ‘cost-effective’, ‘commercial’, and so on. And generally similar sized firms tend to charge similar rates.  So how do you choose between them?  Office swankiness?  How much you like the brand?</p>
        <p>This goes right to the top of the profession.  Have a look at what the three top firms in New Zealand say about themselves:</p>
        <p class="text-center">“Legal guides and directories consistently recognise Bell Gully as being New Zealand's leading firm.”
            <br/> “Russell McVeagh is New Zealand's premier commercial law firm.”
            <br/> “Chapman Tripp is New Zealand's leading full service law firm with offices in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.”</p>
        <p class="text-center">Translation:</p>
        <p class="text-center">"I’m the best”
            <br/> “No, I’m the best”
            <br/> “No way, I’m the best”</p>
        <p>
            These three firms are experiencing the 'Apple vs. Google phenomenon'.  Apple and Google are similar in size, offer similar products, and market to a very similar customer base. So what distinguishes Apple from Google? In other words, where is the real competition between them?  It lies, almost exclusively, in the customer experience.  The same applies to law firms that provide essentially the same services.  They are competing on customer experience alone.  Hence the swanky office. </p>

        <p>Evolution is different.  We have no premises.  Our lawyers work from home offices with remote supervision from Tamina and Thomas, and remote administration and research support.  This is not only a massive cost saving for the firm; it means our lawyers can be more efficient, productive, and (gasp) happy.  That means better quality services for our clients and much lower staff attrition.  All of this is aimed at creating and fostering long-term client relationships.

        <p>Having no central premises has absolutely no negative impact on the quality of the legal product.  Our lawyers are connected to each other 24/7, are subject to the same rules that would apply in any physical law firm, including best practice rules around management, delegation, and peer-review, and make use of all the benefits of modern technology.  </p>
        <p>
            And we mean modern technology.  Tamina and Thomas are the founders of <a href="http://catalex.nz">CataLex</a> – a company at the cutting edge of legal solutions software.  Evolution benefits from its association with CataLex in a number of ways, including by having CataLex develop an online client relationship portal specifically for Evolution.  It also means we can ensure our services are truly modern, and of the highest possible standard.</p>

Let’s talk fees.  Most firms charge by the hour – so do we.  The difference?  We charge different rates according to the service being provided; not the person providing the service.  There are three categories, as per the following table:

            <div class="table-responsive">
                <table class="table">
                    <thead>

                            <th>Fee category</th>
                            <th>Rate</th>
                            <th>Types of work</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>A - Core Legal Services</td>
                            <td>$350</td>
                            <td>Original drafting of instruments and claims, writing a legal opinion, providing written legal advice, providing substantive legal advice over the telephone, Skype, or in person, appearing in Court, acting in a negotiation or mediation, and attending a meeting at your request.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>B - Related Legal Services</td>
                            <td>$250</td>
                            <td>Reviewing documents and evidence, researching the law, considering application of the law, completing a basic precedent document, and correspondence with you, other lawyers, and the Court, including reporting on matter progress, seeking further instructions, and following up deadlines and other known requirements.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>C - Incidental Services</td>
                            <td>$150</td>
                            <td>Proof-reading, compiling a bundle of documents or authorities, administering a data room, and general matter management.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            We believe staggering our rates this way not only promotes efficiency; it also makes for better fee estimates and ensures our fees are reasonable, as required by the <a target="_blank" href="https://browser.catalex.nz/published/10061">Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008</a>.
